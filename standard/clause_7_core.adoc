== Requirements Class "Core"

=== Overview

The "Core" Requirement Class of the _Coverages API_ defines the mandatory requirements for any implementation of a Web API claiming conformance with this _OGC API - Coverages_ standard.
All other requirement classes are optional.

The requirement class depends on _OGC API - Common - Part 2: Geospatial data_, which defines how to list available collections of geospatial data and associate access mechanisms for these collections.

This _Coverages API_ is presented as one such access mechanism for collections of geospatial data which can be modeled as a coverage, defined as
a function returning homogeneous values for any direct position part of its domain.

This requirement class depends on the https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/20-024.html#rc-collections-section[_collections_ requirements class] of _OGC API - Common - Part 2_ which defines
the `/collections` and `/collections/{collectionId}` resources, as well as its https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/20-024.html#rc-umd-collection-section[_uniform multi-dimension collection_ requirements class].
introducing additional requirements standardizing the description of multidimensional data cubes and gridded data.
Each collection accessible as a coverage needs to include a link to the `/collections/{resourceId}/coverage` resource using the `[ogc-rel:coverage]` link relation type, which is used to retrieve the coverage data.

==== Description of the coverage fields

Each collection must also include a link to the `/collections/{collectionId}/schema` resource, using the `[ogc-rel:schema]` relation type, providing a schema of the fields of the coverage supporting a JSON Schema representation,
as defined in _OGC API Common - Part 3: Schemas_ (identical to https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/23-058.html[OGC API - Features - Part 5: Schemas]).
This schema provides equivalent functionality to the Coverage Implementation Schema (CIS) _range type_, including for each field
(the measured or observed property, such as a satellite imagery band, or sea surface temperature) an identifier (the property key), a `title`, a `description`, and a JSON Schema `type`.
Semantic annotations such as the https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/23-058r1.html#_ordering_properties[sequence number of the field], https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/23-058r1.html#_special_null_values[special null values],
a definition URI (see https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/23-058r1.html#_semantic_definition_of_a_property[Semantic definition of a property]),
https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/23-058r1.html#_the_unit_of_measure_for_a_numeric_property[units] describing the nature of each field in a machine-readable way,
or a <<req_core-coverage_fields_schema, resolution specific to a particular field>> should also be included.

==== Description of the coverage domain

The uniform multi-dimension collection requirements class restricts the addition of dimensions beyond spatial and temporal to the `extent` property of the collection description to use a uniform schema.
As with the `temporal` dimension, and similar to the `bbox` of the `spatial` dimension, each additional dimension must include an `interval` property to specify at minimum the overall envelope of the dimension,
and optionally sub-intervals where data is available, if the overall interval is sparsely populated.
The nature of the additional dimensions are also specified using a semantic definition URI from a suitable semantic vocabulary such as QUDT.
For example, a dimension could be identified as representing atmospheric pressure using the URI `https://qudt.org/vocab/quantitykind/AtmosphericPressure`.
If applicable, the unit of measure can also be specified using the case sensitive UCUM representation, or using another unit language by specifying an alternative value for `unitLang`.
For example, if `QUDT` is used, the unit can be a URI from the QUDT Units Vocabulary.
When describing the extent of a coverage, the geometry of its indivudal components, such as cells in the case of a gridded coverage, must be considered.

The native CRS of the data is specified in the `storageCrs` property of the collection description.
For OGC API - Coverages, this native CRS usually specifies the CRS in which the data is most efficiently retrieved and
corresponds to the default output CRS (which may be overridden with a `crs` query parameter if the implementation supports the "Coordinate Reference System" requirements class).
Note that this native CRS is not necessarily how the data is stored internally, as in some use cases different parts of the coverage
might actually be stored in different CRSs (e.g., one per UTM zone), while a CRS like `[OGC:CRS84]` allows to provide the entire coverage in a single unifying CRS.

The `crs` specified in the `spatial` property of the `extent` specifies only the coordinate reference system of the `bbox`, which is primarily for the purpose of discovery and identifying whether the data
spans an area of interest, and does not imply a particular native / storage CRS nor a default output CRS.
For data referenced to Earth, this `crs` will always be `[OGC:CRS84]` or `[OGC:CRS84h]`.
The `storageCrsBbox` property of the `spatial` property of the `extent` allows to specify the bounding box in the native CRS.

The `bbox`, `storageCrsBbox` and the interval bounds in the temporal and/or any additional dimensions of the extent must correspond to the extent of the geometry of the entire coverage.

The extent of each component of a coverage for which values can be retrieved, such as a cell in the context of a gridded coverage, should consider the full _region of validity_ or _bounds_ of that component
to which these values are associated.
For example, in the case of a gridded coverage whose cells represent an area, the extent spans from the lower to the upper bounds of the areas of all those cells.
In the case of a gridded coverage whose cells represent a point, the extent spans from the the lower to the upper coordinate of all those cells.

With the ability to describe grids as detailed below, this collection extent information provides equivalent information to the CIS _domain set_ for most use cases.
For point cloud data, a separate detailed description of the domain is not practical, and a subset of the domain is instead retrieved together with the data, as with the common LAS and LASzip point cloud encodings.
In this case, only the overall interval, and optionally detailed sub-intervals where data is available, can be provided instead within the collection extent.

The multidimensional extent being described is the extent of the coverage up to the boundary of the geometry of its individual components (such as the cells of a gridded coverage).

==== Description of gridded data

A `grid` property for each dimension allows describing the `cellsCount` of the grid.
For regular grids, a `firstCoordinate` as well as well as a cell `resolution` must be specified.
A set of `relativeBounds` coordinates can also be specified indicating the bounds (or region of validity) for each cell relative to `firstCoordinate + n * resolution`.

For irregular grids, a list of individual `coordinates` is used instead.
A parallel set of `boundsCoordinates` pairs can also be specified indicating the coordinates for the bounds (or region of validity) for each cell.

For regular grid coverages:

- the lower bound specified in the `bbox` or `interval` should correspond to `firstCoordinate + relativeBounds[0]`
(with `relativeBounds[0]` defaulting to `-resolution/2` if `relativeBounds` is not specified), while
- the upper bound should correspond to `firstCoordinate + cellsCount * resolution + relativeBounds[1]` (with `relativeBounds[1]` defaulting to `resolution/2` if not specified).

For cell values representing an area centered on each coordinate:

- `relativeBounds` would be set to `[-resolution / 2, resolution / 2]` (the default), and
- `cellsCount = (highBound - lowBound) / resolution`.

For cell values representing a point instead:

- `relativeBounds` would be set to `[0, 0]`, and
- `cellsCount = (highBound - lowBound) / resolution + 1`.
