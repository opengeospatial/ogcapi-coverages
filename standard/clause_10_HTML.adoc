== Requirements Class HTML

The following requirements apply to an OGC API-Coverage implementation when the following conditions apply:

. The API advertises conformance to the HTML Conformance Class
. The client negotiates an HTML format

The HTML Requirements Class restricts requirements defined in the `GeoData-Coverage` Requirements Class by imposing encoding-specific requirements. At this time, these additional requirements only apply to the HTTP response payloads. The sections below identify the scope of each new requirement and the `GeoData-Coverage` requirements which lay within each scope.
