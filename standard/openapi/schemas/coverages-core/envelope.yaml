  The extent (envelope) of the coverage. In Common, currently only spatial and temporal
  extents are specified. Coverages proposes to standardize how additional properties are defined, by specifying intervals and crs properties.

              description: |-
                One or more intervals that describe the extent for this dimension of the dataset.
                The value `null` is supported and indicates an open interval.
                In the Core only a single interval is supported. Extensions may support
                multiple intervals. If multiple intervals are provided, the union of the
                intervals describes the overall extent for the dimension.

                  Lower and upper bound values of the interval. The values
                  are in the coordinate reference system specified in `crs`, `trs` or `vrs`.
