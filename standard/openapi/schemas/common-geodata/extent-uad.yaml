title: Extent with Uniform Additional Dimensions Schema
description: |-
  The extent module only addresses spatial and temporal extents. This module extends extent by specifying how
  intervals and crs properties can be used to specify additional geometries.

    additionalProperties:
       description: |-
         The domain intervals for any additional dimensions of the extent (envelope) beyond those described in temporal and spatial.

       properties:
         interval:
           description: |-
             One or more intervals that describe the extent for this dimension of the dataset.
             The value `null` is supported and indicates an unbounded or half-bounded interval.
             The first interval describes the overall extent of the data for this dimension.
             All subsequent intervals describe more precise intervals, e.g., to identify clusters of data.
             Clients only interested in the overall extent will only need
             to access the first item (a pair of lower and upper bound values).
           type: array

           items:
             description: |-
               Lower and upper bound values of the interval. The values
               are in the coordinate reference system specified in `crs`, `trs` or `vrs`.
