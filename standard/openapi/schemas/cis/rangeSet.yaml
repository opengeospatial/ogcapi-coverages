title: rangeSet
description: 'The rangeSet lists a value for each of the coverage''s direct positions. Values resemble the *payload* information of some particular direct positions. Values can be composite (with a single nesting level, i.e.: composites always consist of atomics), or atomic (emulated through single-component composites) whereby the sequence, structure, and meaning of every value is defined through the rangeType. Values can be represented in-line or by reference to an external file which may have any suitable encoding.'
