# OpenAPI definitions

This example API definition can be used to provide an OpenAPI 3.0 definition for an implementation of _OGC API - Coverages_.
The API definition can be visualized with [SwaggerUI](https://petstore.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-coverages/master/standard/openapi/ogcapi-coverages-1.bundled.json).

The lists of collections and tile matrix sets in the `/api` sub-directory should be tailored to the implementation and deployment, or those `/api/*` paths can be implemented dynamically by the server instead.

The list of supported paths should be adjusted in `ogcapi-coverages-1.yaml`.

# Building the OpenAPI bundle

The `ogcapi-coverages-1.bundled.json` file is a standalone/portable OpenAPI document which includes all dependencies included from the components sub-directories, and is built automatically via GitHub Actions.  To test/build the bundle locally:

```bash
# install Swagger CLI via npm
npm install -g @apidevtools/swagger-cli

# generate OpenAPI bundle
cd standard/openapi
swagger-cli bundle -o ogcapi-coverages-1.bundled.json ogcapi-coverages-1.yaml
```
