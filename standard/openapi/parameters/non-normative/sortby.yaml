sortby:
  description: >-
    The optional sortby parameter indicates the sort property and order on
    which the server shall present results in the response document using
    the convention `sortby=PROPERTY:X`, where `PROPERTY` is the sort
    property and `X` is the sort order (`A` is ascending, `D` is
    descending). Sorting by multiple properties is supported by providing a
    comma-separated list.
