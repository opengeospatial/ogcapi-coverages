^|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |*/req/geodata-coverage/rangetype-op*
^|A |The API SHALL include a link with the relation type `http://www.opengis.net/def/rel/ogc/1.0/coverage-rangetype` within the links of the
coverage (collection) resource, to a resource supporting the HTTP GET operation and returning a CIS JSON representation including a `RangeType` property.
This link can either be a link to a separate resource (e.g., recommended path `/collections/{collectionId}/coverage/rangetype`) or a link to the coverage
resource itself pointing to the property using https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901[RFC 6901 (JSON Pointer)] e.g., `#/RangeType`.

* `collectionId` is the local identifier for a `Coverage`. It serves the same role and is subject to the same requirements as the `collectionid` parameter defined in API-Common.
