^|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |*/req/coverage/collection-links*
2+|The `links` element of a `Collection` resource SHALL include links to the following resources:
^|A |the coverage as a whole (always available at `/collections/{collectionId}/coverage`) using relation type `http://www.opengis.net/def/rel/ogc/1.0/coverage`,
^|B |the coverage domainset (commonly at `/collections/{collectionId}/coverage/domainset`, but possibly a JSON pointer) using relation type `http://www.opengis.net/def/rel/ogc/1.0/coverage-domainset,
^|C |the coverage rangetype (commonly at `/collections/{collectionId}/coverage/rangetype`, but possibly a JSON pointer) using relation type `http://www.opengis.net/def/rel/ogc/1.0/coverage-rangetype,
^|D |if available separately, the coverage rangeset (always at `/collections/{collectionId}/coverage/rangeset`) using relation type `http://www.opengis.net/def/rel/ogc/1.0/coverage-rangeset, and
^|E |if available, the coverage metadata (always at `/collections/{collectionId}/coverage/metadata`) using relation type `http://www.opengis.net/def/rel/ogc/1.0/coverage-metadata.
^|F |if an explicit media type (`type` property) is specified in the links for the domain set or range type, at least one of those links SHALL have the media type associated with CIS JSON (currently `application/json`).
|===

NOTE: JSON pointers are defined by https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901[RFC 6901 (JSON Pointer)].
NOTE: The links for domain set and range type resources can either be links to separate resources, or JSON Pointers, which could possibly link to the
coverage (collection) description resource itself, pointing to the property using  e.g., `#/RangeType` or `#/DomainSet`.
