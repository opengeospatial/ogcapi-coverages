== Requirement Class "Coordinate Reference System by Reference"

=== Overview

The "Coordinate Reference System by Reference" requirement class specifies a `crs` parameter allowing a client to select an output CRS (equivalent to `OUTPUTCRS` in WCS 2.0).

As defined in this standard, a coverage is conceptually associated with native CRS (also called a _storage CRS_) which is indicated in the collection description.
This native CRS is the default output CRS if no `crs` parameter is specified, and the only supported output CRS without support for this requirements class.
The `Content-Crs:` header (see <<rc_core>>) specifies the CRS used in the response to avoid any confusion as to the CRS of a response.
