f:
  description: >-
    The optional f parameter indicates the output format which the server
    shall provide as part of the response document. It has preference over
    the HTTP Accept header. The default format is JSON.

sortby:
  description: >-
    The optional sortby parameter indicates the sort property and order on
    which the server shall present results in the response document using
    the convention `sortby=PROPERTY:X`, where `PROPERTY` is the sort
    property and `X` is the sort order (`A` is ascending, `D` is
    descending). Sorting by multiple properties is supported by providing a
    comma-separated list.

startindex:

    document. The first element has an index of 0 (default).

bbox:
  name: bbox

  description: >-
    Only features that have a geometry that intersects the bounding box are selected.
    The bounding box is provided as four or six numbers, depending on whether the
    coordinate reference system includes a vertical axis (height or depth):

    * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 1
    * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 2
    * Minimum value, coordinate axis 3 (optional)
    * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 1
    * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 2
    * Maximum value, coordinate axis 3 (optional)

    The coordinate reference system of the values is WGS 84 longitude/latitude
    (http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84) unless a different coordinate
    reference system is specified in the parameter `bbox-crs`.

    For WGS 84 longitude/latitude the values are in most cases the sequence of
    minimum longitude, minimum latitude, maximum longitude and maximum latitude.
    However, in cases where the box spans the antimeridian the first value
    (west-most box edge) is larger than the third value (east-most box edge).

    If the vertical axis is included, the third and the sixth number are
    the bottom and the top of the 3-dimensional bounding box.

    If a feature has multiple spatial geometry properties, it is the decision of the
    server whether only a single spatial geometry property is used to determine
    the extent or all relevant geometries.

    Either a date-time or an interval, open or closed. Date and time expressions
    adhere to RFC 3339. Open intervals are expressed using double-dots.

    Examples:

    * A date-time: "2018-02-12T23:20:50Z"
    * A closed interval: "2018-02-12T00:00:00Z/2018-03-18T12:31:12Z"
    * Open intervals: "2018-02-12T00:00:00Z/.." or "../2018-03-18T12:31:12Z"

    Only features that have a temporal property that intersects the value of
    `datetime` are selected.

    If a feature has multiple temporal properties, it is the decision of the
    server whether only a single temporal property is used to determine
    the extent or all relevant temporal properties.

    requested items shall not be counted.
